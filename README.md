# Spheracle
Spheracle is PHP library for writing your application's domain logic in a framework-independent way. Spheracle makes use of [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) concepts to help you create modular and readable domain logic code. Out of the box, Spheracle provides classes and interfaces for both your application's Domain layer and Application Service layer. For your Domain layer, Spheracle provides classes and interfaces for: 
- Entities
- Value Objects
- Domain Services
- Factories
- Repositories

For your Application Service layer, Spheracle provides base classes for:
- Application Services
- Data Transport Objects (DTOs).
