# Javelin
Javelin is PHP library for writing your application's domain logic in a framework-independent way. Javelin uses the concepts of [Domain-Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) to create modular and readable domain logic code. Out of the box, Javelin provides classes and interfaces for both your application's Domain layer and Application Service layer. For your Domain layer, Javelin provides classes and interfaces for: 
- Entities
- Value Objects
- Domain Services
- Factories
- Repositories

For your Application Service layer, Javelin provides base classes for:
- Application Services
- Data Transport Objects (DTOs).
